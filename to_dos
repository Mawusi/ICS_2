                    <h4>What is NDIS?</h4>
                    <p>The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) has been developed to improve choice and create better outcomes for people with a disability. NDIS funds any goal that you set for yourself (those that NDIS considers reasonable and fair of course) and you are free to choose any NDIS service provider you want. You can learn more about the NDIS on the official federal government NDIS website.</p>
